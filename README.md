# How to Setup the Bot üî®

- Invite the bot using [this](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1402372113175941210&permissions=2617502769&integration_type=0&scope=bot) link.
- Create an account on https://jsonbin.io.
- Once created, go to https://jsonbin.io/app/bins and create 2 new bins. Use the placeholders below in the bin. Save these somewhere safe.

**Ban Placeholder:**

```json
[
  {
    "userid": 1,
    "reason": "Example ban",
    "clip": "https://example.com/proof.png",
    "author": 123456789012345680
  }
]
```
**Kick Placeholder:**
```json
[
  {
    "userid": 0,
    "kicked_by": ""
  }
]
```
- Go to https://jsonbin.io/app/app/api-keys and copy your "X-Master-Key". This allows the bot to access your bins.
- Use the config command on the bot and press "Edit Config", and fill out the information. 
- Use the whitelist command to set up the roles allowed to use ban, kick, unban and get commands.

# How to Setup the Roblox stuff! üî®
- Once the bot is set up, head to [this](https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/130010432442031/RoCommand) link to get the RoCommand server logic for roblox.
- Put this into ServerScriptService, and ensure you have enabled **Studio Access to API Services** and allowed **HTTP Requests**!
- Head to the module script called "RoCommand" inside the "Server" script, and paste your ban bin ID, kick bin ID and Master Key inside of the table! 
- Once this has all been done, the bot **should** work.
